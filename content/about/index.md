This site was originally set up due to my desire to help get old games up and running. I've amassed many during my time on PC and part of me just wants to share my setup for the games I play with others.

Additionally, I'm testing the waters out on how to get an RPG going. Any dev work will be found under the "solana" category and may end up as a separate page here once I feel it's ready.
