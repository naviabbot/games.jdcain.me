It all started when I had the random idea to meld the aesthetic and story telling of a Japanese RPG with the renown system of D&D and Final Fantasy XI and an semi-open world.

Basically, an episodic RPG where you aren't fully confined to a story line, but make your story by taking on quests. Each quest is locked behind a certain renown amount and you earn renown from taking on other quests. In a way, it's almost like how jobs are locked in Phantasy Star Universe.

Right now, the working title is Solana... and that's all I really have to offer, unfortunately. The game will be crafted in RPG Maker MV using the Yanfly Engine wherever possible.
