This is guaranteed to work on the latest version of Manjaro with the NVIDIA Prime settings in place.

## Requirements
- Steam
- Patience
- A registered copy of Final Fantasy XI (As well as your account details - SQEX and PlayOnline info)

## Instructions (Outdated - new ones coming soon... hopefully)

1. Enable Steam Play for all titles in Settings > Steam Play
2. Install Final Fantasy XI
3. Under Preferences > Steam Play, set the Proton version to 4.11
4. Launch and let pre-requisites install
5. Update PlayOnline and Final Fantasy XII

This is basically everything you need.
