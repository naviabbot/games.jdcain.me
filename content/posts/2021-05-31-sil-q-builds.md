Salutations to all who find this page. After being inspired to give Sil a shot, I have compiled the latest build of Sil-Q and am hosting the current Windows build on this site.

For those who don't know, I am into roguelikes. These are notoriously difficult games that are still fun in the end. If you are wondering what a roguelike is, the best place to read up would be the "What a roguelike is" article on RogueBasin, [found here](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=What_a_roguelike_is). As for Sil, Sil is a descendant of the Angband family, which has roots in Moria. The goal of Sil is that you play as one of Tolkien's First Age elves, seeking to regain one of the lost Silmarils, stolen by the Dark Lord Morgoth (AKA Melkor). Delve deep into 20 levels of dungeon, sneak or fight your way past opponents, get the sparkling jewel from the crown, and begin your Ascension!

If this sounds like something you'd like to play and you are on Windows, then kindly apply pressure [here](//games.jdcain.me/sil-q/latest.7z). I'll begin archiving all versions since commit 87d8c78 onward once they come out.
