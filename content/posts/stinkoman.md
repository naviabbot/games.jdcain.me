This may come at a shock, but we are now living in a Post-Flash era. As such, some of our favorite games are no longer available. However, [BlueMaxima's Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/) has been able to fix this. One game though does come at a loss. I know I have tweeted this earlier, but it serves a proper writeup. For fans of Stinkoman 20X6 at Homestarrunner.com, Level 10 is no longer live, as it requires AS3 to work. Support for such isn't widely available in Ruffle, which is a flash emulator.

There is a way to fix this by using Flashpoint. At the time of this writing, the version stored on the archival servers only goes up to Level 9, which means it's not up to date. Download it anyway, this can be fixed by downloading the latest version from homestarrunner.com. (Just click [here](https://homestarrunner.com/media/pages/stinkogame/5c5726aa03-1610907913/stinkogame.swf) to get it.) Move it to <Flashpoint Dir>\Legacy\htdocs\localflash\stinkoman20x6\stinkogame.swf. (If you are prompted to save, save it and overwrite it there.)

Now, when you load up Stinkoman 20X6 from Flashpoint, you should get the new game.

EDIT: The game has been moved from old.homestarrunner.com to just homestarrunner.com. However, as Stinkoman 20X6 uses ActionScript 3, Ruffle isn't able to 100% emulate it. Chromium based browsers are especially at fault - Firefox seems to run it "alright", however, Google Chrome, MS Edge and Brave Browser all seem to be broken. However, this move may make it easier for the Flashpoint team to update their files.
