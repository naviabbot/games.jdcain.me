## Note: This article may be years out of date. 

### This hasn't been attempted yet with any new tech, such as Valve's Proton and any sort of DXVK-like proxy. Please bare the mess and tweet @kmartkart or send a toot to @t3hyoshi@pleroma.soykaf.com with any corrections. You'll get a special thanks in this article.

## Requirements;
- Wine (At least 1.7 or higher, Proton will more than likely work for this.)
- A registered copy of Final Fantasy XI (As well as your account details - SQEX and PlayOnline info)

## Instructions (Outdated - new ones coming soon... hopefully)

1. Install Steam as a preconfigured wineprefix using Winetricks
2. Select "Use Steam" in the first window
3. Enter DLLs.
4. Install DX8 and DXDiag.
5. Install Final Fantasy XI in Steam
6. Update PlayOnline. It'll probably complain about missing some file. This is fine.
7. Close Steam and relaunch.
8. Update Final Fantasy XI

This is basically everything you need.
