Now, I'm not 100% a connoisseur of trash games, but one holds a strange spot in my heart, thanks to Jon Burton of Tt ([Youtube - Coding Secrets](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkY047vYjF92-8HcoVTXAOg)) revealing all his secrets on this title. I'm of course speaking of Sonic R. It's a simple, yet difficult to control title and those tunes... they are bangers! Each and every one, in a corny, yet truthful sort of way. There is a way to get any PC copy working. That method is cheatfreak47's [SRUpdater](https://github.com/cheatfreak47/SRUpdater). This application will get older versions working on Windows just fine. The game's executable so happens to be a 16-bit only application. Even if you were to use WineVDM to launch the app, you'd come to the problem that Sonic R will find your processor *way too fast!*

## Install
1. Copy a Sonic R install off of the old cd onto a HDD. The SETUP file will just fail out on newer systems.
2. Download the latest copy from the "Releases" page on the linked Github repo.
3. Install it to your Sonic R directory
4. Play.

Simple as that, really
