Lee Jackson, the Composer of Infinite Power, has released "Duke Nukem Tank Tracks" in various packages - including one "OGG Pack" for use with the World Tour edition (Or, as Civvie11 calls it - the Greasy Randy Edition). While he didn't imply it can be used for other versions, I put together a skeleton structure so that it can be used in eDuke32.

All you need to do is clone [this repository](https://github.com/naviabbot/dn-tanktracks-eduke32), follow the instructions, and enjoy.

Oh, you're going to want [this](https://montrose.is/dnttoggpack/).
