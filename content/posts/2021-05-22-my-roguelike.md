The mother of all CRPGs - Rogue. Today, many "Roguelike" games focus on probably one or two things found in Rogue - Permadeath and Procedurally Generated floors. Many though just don't seem to have the charm of guiding "@" around a maze of unknowns like the Major Roguelikes do.  

Per Roguebasin, the largest wiki on the topic itself, the Major Classic Roguelikes are Rogue, Hack, Moria, Larn, Omega, which have all spawned todays majors - ADOM, ToME, Angband, Crawl (Stone Soup), and Nethack. I've tried Moria, Larn, Rogue, Nethack, and Angband. This, I have to say. Angband is wild. It's nothing like the others. Angband today has multiple windows to minimize the number of keypresses to see around you, in your pack, in the logs, and in the bestiary.

Much like Nethack today, Angband does have tilesets one can use to try and play the game. Though, whether or not you stick with them or revert to ASCII is up to you - the game is still playable.

I've always experienced an issue with Nethack, where sometimes, dungeon floors are generated without a way to access the next level.

Angband, however, does have floor exits on every floor. It also seems that each floor is different every time you visit it. Some might not like that. But I have found an exit on each floor variation I've visited. The town level, which is taken from Angband's predecessor - Moria - does also make things a lot easier than Nethack.  

Over all, it's something I do recommend all play.
