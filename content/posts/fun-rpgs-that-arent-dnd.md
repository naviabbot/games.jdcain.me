Alright nerdlings. I'm not sure how many actually read this, but I've been on a classic RPG kick. Here's a few of my favorite OSRs, including links to get it. These aren't affiliate links. If there's a free version, I'll link to the DL page or the product page with the publisher.

## FASERIP
FASERIP is a "neoclone" of the 1980 TSR "Marvel Super Heroes RPG" system. It's flexible, fast to learn, and really easy to play. It's PWYW off of DriveThruRPG and made by Gurbintroll Games. [Game Site](https://gurbintrollgames.wordpress.com/faserip/)

## Lightmaster
Another Gurbintroll Games production (most of these are...). It's an odd mix of Rolemaster, 3.5, and Spelljammer that is easy to play. The entire ruleset is spread across two books - the Core Rulebook and the Book of Tables. The game also has rules taking the standard 1d20 and giving it a Rolemaster upgrade into the 1e20. Looks very fun and character creation is very nostalgic. [Game Site](https://gurbintrollgames.wordpress.com/lightmaster/)

## Dark Dungeons
Okay, I swear, this is the last Gurbintroll game. This one is a classic among OSR fans. A retroclone version of TSR's D&D BECMI by Frank Mentzer, this has it all - apatheosis, race as class, warfare, dominion - the whole nine yards of Basic D&D. There's two different versions - [Dark Dungeons](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/177410/) and [Dark Dungeons X](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/310711/Dark-Dungeons-X). Take your pick. Both are PWYW with no minimum.

## Labyrinth Lord
Another OSR OGL remake of Basic - this one seems more close to B/X by Tom Moldvay and Dave Cook. It also has an Advanced Companion, allowing to convert LL into something close to AD&D 1e. A free version exists without art on [Goblinoid Games](http://goblinoidgames.com/index.php/downloads/). The art-filled version is ~$10 US at [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/64332/Labyrinth-Lord-Revised-Edition?src=hottest_filtered)

## OSRIC
Here's the big one - the one that started the OSR. The Old School Reference and Index Compilation. It's a free game, PDF can be downloaded from their [website](https://osricrpg.com/get.php). Links to get a physical copy are on the "Get" page.

## For Gold and Glory
An attempt to bring Advanced 2nd Edition back. This one book is full of character options, creatures, and DM suggestions. This was produced by God Emperor Games and is only available from OneBookshelf ([AKA - DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/156530/For-Gold--Glory))

## Godbound
Ever wanted to become a god? This is the game then. [It's even free](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/185959/Godbound-A-Game-of-Divine-Heroes-Free-Edition)a

## Mythender
Another way to become a god, but are you sure you want to get to that level? Another free game. [Find it here](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/110779/Mythender-Roleplaying-Game)

## Maid
An RPG from Japan where the players play as maids, tending to their master. Note, this game is sorta kinky, so, don't play if you've no time for lewd maids. [Get it here](http://www.maidrpg.com/)
