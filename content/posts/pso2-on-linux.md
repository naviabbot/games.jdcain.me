We all know that PSO2 on Linux is not a thing. This is due to GameGuard, a Ring 0 Anti-Cheat that makes it hard for Wine/Proton to emulate. This article is for reference due to a discovery or two. If GameGuard was not a thing, it would be highly possible to run PSO2 on Linux. As of this writing, GameGuard does not detect and ban for using DXVK over standard DirectX 9 libraries.

For those of you who don't know, DXVK is a library that translates DirectX calls to Vulkan, allowing for a more native way to draw graphics on a non-Windows system. Additionally, Windows gamers can take advantage of DXVK to get use out of new features found in Vulkan. DXVK can talk DirectX 9-11.

Further more, with the release of DX12 on Linux, this does make the fact that the libraries are readily available for Linux. With the new engine coming, there is an opportunity to harness these Linux libraries and help develop the gaming scene on the new frontier, one that Gabe Newell wanted to reach out to and successfully tap into.

Again, if it weren't for GameGuard, we could all play this game together, for great justice.
